= Description of Web Map Services =

The Critical Site Network tool displays a range of information about migratory birds and the sites they use using a set of maps that have been developed at UNEP-WCMC. These maps are available in the CSN tool itself but they are also available separately through a number of Web Mapping Services. These services allow other software tools and clients to access and display the maps in their own environment and allow the user to customise how they view and interact with the maps.
