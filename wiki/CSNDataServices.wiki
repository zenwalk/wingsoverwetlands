#summary Describes the Web Data Services that are available for the Critical Site Network tool.

= Overview of the Web Data Services =

The Critical Site Network tool displays a range of information about migratory birds and the sites they use using a set of maps and other non-spatial data that have been developed at UNEP-WCMC. The non-spatial data includes information about species, sites and a number of other themes. These non-spatial data are available in the CSN tool itself but they are also available separately through a number of Web Data Services. These services allow other software tools and clients, e.g. Microsoft Excel, to access and use the data in their own environment and allow the user to customise how they work with and summarise the data.
